# Counting fractions in a range

<p>Consider the fraction, <i>n/d</i>, where <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are positive integers. If <i>n</i>&lt;<i>d</i> and HCF(<i>n,d</i>)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.</p>
<p>If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:</p>
<p class="center smaller">1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, <b>3/8, 2/5, 3/7</b>, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8</p>
<p>It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.</p>
<p>How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> ≤ 12,000?</p>
