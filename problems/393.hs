# Migrating ants

<p>
An  <var>n</var>Ã—<var>n</var> grid of squares contains  <var>n</var><sup>2</sup> ants, one ant per square.<br />
All ants decide to move simultaneously to an adjacent square (usually 4 possibilities, except for ants on the edge of the grid or at the corners).<br />
We define <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) to be the number of ways this can happen without any ants ending on the same square and without any two ants crossing the same edge between two squares.
</p>
<p>
You are given that <var>f</var>(4) = 88.<br />
Find  <var>f</var>(10).
</p>
