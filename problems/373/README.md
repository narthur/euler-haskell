# Circumscribed Circles

<p>
Every triangle has a circumscribed circle that goes through the three vertices.
Consider all integer sided triangles for which the radius of the circumscribed circle is integral as well.
</p>
<p>
Let S(<var>n</var>) be the sum of the radii of the circumscribed circles of all such triangles for which the radius does not exceed <var>n</var>.
</p>
<p>S(100)=4950 and S(1200)=1653605.
</p>
<p>
Find S(10<sup>7</sup>).
