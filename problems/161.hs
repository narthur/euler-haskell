<p>Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with triominoes.<br />
If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be  tiled with triominoes:</p>

<p>In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?</p>
