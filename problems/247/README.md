# Squares under a hyperbola

<p>Consider the region constrained by 1 ≤ <var>x</var> and 0 ≤ <var>y</var> ≤ <sup>1</sup>/<sub><var>x</var></sub>.
</p><p>
Let S<sub>1</sub> be the largest square that can fit under the curve.<br />
Let S<sub>2</sub> be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on. <br />
Let the <i>index</i> of S<sub><var>n</var></sub> be the pair (left, below) indicating the number of squares to the left of S<sub><var>n</var></sub> and the number of squares below S<sub><var>n</var></sub>.
</p>
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p247_hypersquares.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>
<p>
The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number. <br />
S<sub>2</sub> has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S<sub>2</sub> is (1,0).<br />
It can be seen that the index of S<sub>32</sub> is (1,1) as is the index of S<sub>50</sub>. <br />
50 is the largest <var>n</var> for which the index of S<sub><var>n</var></sub> is (1,1).
</p>
<p>
What is the largest <var>n</var> for which the index of S<sub><var>n</var></sub> is (3,3)?
