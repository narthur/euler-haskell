# Tri-colouring a triangular grid

<p>Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:</p>

<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p189_grid.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

<p>We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.<br />
Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.</p> 

<p>For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:</p>
<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p189_colours.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

<p>A colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered <i>distinct</i> from C unless the two are identical.</p>

<p>How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?</p>
