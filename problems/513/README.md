# Integral median

<p>
ABC is an integral sided triangle with sides a≤b≤c.<br />
m<sub>c</sub> is the median connecting C and the midpoint of AB. <br />
F(n) is the number of such triangles with  c≤n for which m<sub>c</sub> has integral length as well.<br />
F(10)=3 and F(50)=165.</p>
<p>
Find F(100000).
