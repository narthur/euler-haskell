# Sum of digits - experience #13

<p>
There are 16 positive integers that do not have a zero in their digits and that have a digital sum equal to 5, namely: <br />
5, 14, 23, 32, 41, 113, 122, 131, 212, 221, 311, 1112, 1121, 1211, 2111 and 11111.<br />
Their sum is 17891.
</p>
<p>
Let <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) be the sum of all positive integers that do not have a zero in their digits and have a digital sum equal to <var>n</var>.
</p>
<p>
Find $\displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^{17} f(13^i)$.<br />
Give the last 9 digits as your answer.
