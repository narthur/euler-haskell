# Empty chairs

<p>
In a room <var>N</var> chairs are placed around a round table.<br />
Knights enter the room one by one and choose at random an available empty chair.<br />
To have enough elbow room the knights always leave at least one empty chair between each other.
</p>
<p>
When there aren't any suitable chairs left, the fraction <var>C</var> of empty chairs is determined.<br />
We also define E(<var>N</var>) as the expected value of <var>C</var>.<br />
We can verify that E(4) = 1/2 and E(6) = 5/9.
</p>
<p>
Find E(10<sup>18</sup>). Give your answer rounded to fourteen decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghijklmn.
