# Rectangles in cross-hatched grids

<p>In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p147.png" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>
<p>There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:</p>
<table class="grid" style="margin:0 auto;"><tr><td style="width:50px;">1x1</td><td style="width:50px;">1</td></tr><tr><td>2x1</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>3x1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>1x2</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2x2</td><td>18</td></tr></table><p>Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.</p>

<p>How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?</p>
