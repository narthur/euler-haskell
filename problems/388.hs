# Distinct Lines

<p>
Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 ≤ a,b,c ≤ N.
</p>
<p>
From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.<br />
Let D(N) be the number of <i>distinct</i> such lines.
</p>
<p>
You are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.
</p><p>
Find D(10<sup>10</sup>). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.
