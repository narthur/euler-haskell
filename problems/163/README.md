# Cross-hatched triangles

<p>Consider an equilateral triangle in which straight lines are drawn from each vertex to the middle of the opposite side, such as in the <i>size 1</i> triangle in the sketch below.</p>
<div class="center"><img src="project/images/p163.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>
<p>Sixteen triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that triangle. Using <i>size 1</i> triangles as building blocks, larger triangles can be formed, such as the <i>size 2</i> triangle in the above sketch. One-hundred and four triangles of either different shape or size or orientation or location can now be observed in that <i>size 2</i> triangle.</p>
<p>It can be observed that the <i>size 2</i> triangle contains 4 <i>size 1</i> triangle building blocks. A <i>size 3</i> triangle would contain 9 <i>size 1</i> triangle building blocks and a <i>size n</i> triangle would thus contain <i>n<sup>2</sup> size 1</i> triangle building blocks.</p>
<p>If we denote T(<var>n</var>) as the number of triangles present in a triangle of <i>size <var>n</var></i>, then</p>
<p class="margin_left">T(1) = 16<br />
T(2) = 104</p>
<p>Find T(36).</p>
