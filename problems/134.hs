# Prime pair connection


<p>Consider the consecutive primes <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = 19 and <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> = 23. It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> whilst also being divisible by <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>In fact, with the exception of <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> = 3 and <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> = 5, for every pair of consecutive primes, <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> &gt; <i>p</i><sub>1</sub>, there exist values of <i>n</i> for which the last digits are formed by <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>n</i> is divisible by <i>p</i><sub>2</sub>. Let <i>S</i> be the smallest of these values of <i>n</i>.</p>
<p>Find ∑ <i>S</i> for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> ≤ 1000000.</p>
