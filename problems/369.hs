# Badugi

<p>In a standard 52 card deck of playing cards, a set of 4 cards is a <b>Badugi</b> if it contains 4 cards with no pairs and no two cards of the same suit.</p>

<p>Let f(<var>n</var>) be the number of ways to choose <var>n</var> cards with a 4 card subset that is a Badugi.  For example, there are 2598960 ways to choose five cards from a standard 52 card deck, of which 514800 contain a 4 card subset that is a Badugi, so f(5) = 514800.</p>

<p>Find <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">∑</span></span> f(<var>n</var>)  for 4 ≤ <var>n</var> ≤ 13.</p>
