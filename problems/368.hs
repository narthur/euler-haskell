# A Kempner-like series

<p>The <b> harmonic series </b> $1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3} + \dfrac{1}{4} + ...$ is well known to be divergent.</p>

<p>If we however omit from this series every term where the denominator has a 9 in it, the series remarkably enough converges to approximately 22.9206766193.<br />
This modified harmonic series is called the <b>Kempner</b> series.</p>

<p>Let us now consider another modified harmonic series by omitting from the harmonic series every term where the denominator has 3 or more equal consecutive digits.
One can verify that out of the first 1200 terms of the harmonic series, only 20 terms will be omitted.<br />
These 20 omitted terms are:</p>
<p>$$\dfrac{1}{111}, \dfrac{1}{222}, \dfrac{1}{333}, \dfrac{1}{444}, \dfrac{1}{555}, \dfrac{1}{666}, \dfrac{1}{777}, \dfrac{1}{888}, \dfrac{1}{999}, \dfrac{1}{1000}, \dfrac{1}{1110},$$
$$\dfrac{1}{1111}, \dfrac{1}{1112}, \dfrac{1}{1113}, \dfrac{1}{1114}, \dfrac{1}{1115}, \dfrac{1}{1116}, \dfrac{1}{1117}, \dfrac{1}{1118}, \dfrac{1}{1119}$$</p>

<p>This series converges as well.</p>

<p>Find the value the series converges to.<br />
Give your answer rounded to 10 digits behind the decimal point.</p>
