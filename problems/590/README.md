# Sets with a given Least Common Multiple

<p>
Let H(<var>n</var>) denote the number of sets of positive integers such that the least common multiple of the integers in the set equals <var>n</var>.<br />
E.g.:<br />
The integers in the following ten sets all have a least common multiple of 6:<br />
{2,3}, {1,2,3}, {6}, {1,6}, {2,6} ,{1,2,6}, {3,6}, {1,3,6}, {2,3,6} and {1,2,3,6}.<br />
Thus H(6)=10.
</p>
<p>
Let L(<var>n</var>) denote the least common multiple of the numbers 1 through <var>n</var>.<br />
E.g. L(6) is the least common multiple of the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6 and L(6) equals 60.
</p>
<p>
Let HL(<var>n</var>) denote H(L(<var>n</var>)).<br />
You are given HL(4)=H(12)=44.
</p>
<p>
Find HL(50000). Give your answer modulo 10<sup>9</sup>.
