# Pythagorean Polygons

<p>We shall define a <i>pythagorean polygon</i>  to be a <b>convex polygon</b> with the following properties:<br /></p><ul><li>there are at least three vertices,</li>
<li>no three vertices are aligned,</li>
<li>each vertex has <b>integer coordinates</b>,</li>
<li>each edge has <b>integer length</b>.</li></ul><p>For a given integer <var>n</var>, define P(<var>n</var>) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is ≤ <var>n</var>.<br />
Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.</p>

<p>You are given that P(4) = 1, P(30) = 3655 and P(60) = 891045.<br />
Find P(120).</p>
