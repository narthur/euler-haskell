# Crack-free Walls

<p>Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2×1 and 3×1 bricks (horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".</p>

<p>For example, the following 9×3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:</p>

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p215_crackfree.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

<p>There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9×3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.</p>

<p>Calculate W(32,10).</p>
