# Diophantine reciprocals I

<p>In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive integers.</p>
$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$
<p>For <var>n</var> = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:</p>
$$\begin{align}
\dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{20} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{12} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{8} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{align}
$$

<p>What is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?</p>
