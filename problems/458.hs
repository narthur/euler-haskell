# Permutations of Project

<p>
Consider the alphabet A made out of the letters of the word "project": A={c,e,j,o,p,r,t}.<br />
Let T(n) be the number of strings of length n consisting of letters from A that do not have a substring that is one of the 5040 permutations of "project".
</p>
T(7)=7<sup>7</sup>-7!=818503.

<p>
Find T(10<sup>12</sup>). Give the last 9 digits of your answer.
