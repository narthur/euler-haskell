# Lattice Quadrilaterals

<p>A <b>simple quadrilateral</b> is a polygon that has four distinct vertices, has no straight angles and does not self-intersect.</p>

<p>Let Q(m, n) be the number of simple quadrilaterals whose vertices are lattice points with coordinates (x,y) satisfying 0 ≤ x ≤ m and 0 ≤ y ≤ n.</p>

<p>For example, Q(2, 2) = 94 as can be seen below:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="project/images/p453_quad.png" class="dark_img" alt="p453_quad.png" /></p>
<p>It can also be verified that Q(3, 7) = 39590, Q(12, 3) = 309000 and Q(123, 45) = 70542215894646.</p>

<p>Find Q(12345, 6789) mod 135707531.</p>
