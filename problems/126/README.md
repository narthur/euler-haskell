# Cuboid layers

<p>The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring 3 x 2 x 1 is twenty-two.</p>
<div class="center">

<p>If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.</p>
<p>However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5 x 1 x 1 also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5 x 3 x 1, 7 x 2 x 1, and 11 x 1 x 1 all contain forty-six cubes.</p>
<p>We shall define C(<i>n</i>) to represent the number of cuboids that contain <i>n</i> cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) = 8.</p>
<p>It turns out that 154 is the least value of <i>n</i> for which C(<i>n</i>) = 10.</p>
<p>Find the least value of <i>n</i> for which C(<i>n</i>) = 1000.</p>
