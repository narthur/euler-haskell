# Square digit chains


<p>A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p class="margin_left">44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → <b>1</b> → <b>1</b><br />
85 → <b>89</b> → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → <b>89</b></p>
<p>Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.</p>
<p>How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?</p>
